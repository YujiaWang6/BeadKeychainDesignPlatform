# BeadKeychainDesignPlatform
I created this Bead Keychain Design Platform that I hope it could replace the bead design board in the real world!

## Functions
- It allows users to store their beads online, including uploaded the image of beads to visualize exact look of that specific bead. They can CRUD the bead on the website.
- There is the list of bead colour which allows user to see all the beads in that specific colour. Also, users can CRUD the colour on the website.
- Besides the beads themselves, there is keychain option which allow user to create their own keychain online! They can add/remove the bead to specific keychain, in that specific keychain, they can see the pictures of all the beads in that specific keychain. They can also CRUD the keychain to manage their design.
